    - subject: Update channel name, slug, and query
      hash: 24dedab95a42bfd1d343873830374602d9a8892d
      body: |
        Revert channel slug back to channel-user-feedback so as to not
        cause user interruption for those who frequent the channel. Update the
        query to match both old user-feedback contracts and the new
        typeform-feedback contracts. Will restrict to typeform-feedback
        contracts once the type transition is complete.
